# NN-DecisionTree-LinearReg

This project implements three different models – Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression – for a regression task. The goal is to compare the performance of these models on the given task.

# Results:

# Neural Networks

Mean squared error from neural net: 14,965,842.0

Mean absolute error from neural net: 2,351.140625

Performance of the model: 89.12%

# Decision Tree

Mean squared error using Random Forest: 17,830,176.94

Mean absolute error using Random Forest: 2,314.80704245

The new performance of the model: 88.12%

# Linear Regression

Mean squared error from linear regression: 29,948,617.86

Mean absolute error from linear regression: 3,911.84151567

The performance of the Linear model: 80.05%
